# GeneticProgramming 

Genetic Programming (GP) is a type of Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), a subset of machine learning. EAs are used to discover solutions to problems humans do not know how to solve, directly. Free of human preconceptions or biases, the adaptive nature of EAs can generate solutions that are comparable to, and often better than the best human efforts.

In tree-based GP, the computer programs are represented in tree structures that are evaluated recursively to produce the resulting multivariate expressions. Traditional nomenclature states that a tree node (or just node) is an operator [+,-,*,/] and a terminal node (or leaf) is a variable [a,b,c,d].
